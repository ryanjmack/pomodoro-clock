# Pomodoro Clock

This is a web based pomodoro clock app. The user can change the time allotted for work and also their break. To start/pause the timer click the time or click the space bar. If the user wants to alter the time they must reset or pause the timer and make changes accordingly. Once the timer ends the user will be alerted.
